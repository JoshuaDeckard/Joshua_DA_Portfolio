# Joshua Deckard-Anderson's Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! Heavy inspiration was taken from Cryptal Coders youtube video which can be found here[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aCoZudPEKE&t=8684s&ab_channel=CrypticalCoder]. While the original was a great starting point, and a lot of influence was taken, I made extensive changes to the original to better fit my needs and wants. This website was built using JavaScript and React.

## Project Overview
This project was a great learning opportunity that I used to deepen my React knowledge. This project serves as a comprehensive portfolio that details who I am, my work experience, and offers ways to get into contact with me. 

## Getting Started
To launch my portfolio locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project's root directory
3. Run `npm install` to install Node Package Manager
4. Run `npm start` to launch the development server
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` if it does not open a tab automatically.
