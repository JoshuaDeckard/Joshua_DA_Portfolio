# Joshua Deckard-Anderson's Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! Heavy inspiration was taken from Cryptal Coders youtube video which can be found here[LINK NEEDS TO BE ADDED]. This website was built using JavaScript and the React library which allowed me to provide a dynamic and interactable site.

## Project Overview
This project was a great learning opportunity and I used the learning process to deepen my React knowledge. This project also employs modular programming techniques to ensure maintainability. Several changes were made to the source code to better suit my needs and improve the users experince.

## Getting Started
To launch my portfolio locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project's root directory
3. Run `npm install` to install Node Package Manager
4. Run `npm start` to launch the development server
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` if it does not open a tab automatically.
